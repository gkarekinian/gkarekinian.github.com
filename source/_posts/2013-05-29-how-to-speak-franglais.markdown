An [entire article written in Franglais, on the BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-22655534).

The whole thing is worth reading, here's one of my favorite paragraphs from it:

> Which portez moi to un point tres important. Si vous desirez le langage
> Francaise survivre pour tres jolies much longes, get votre prononciation
> sorti! Tous that eu, a, ong et onnhh: franchement, c'est un mess, tous over
> la boutique.

[Englishisms in France: Readers' franglais favourites](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22636888):

>  I have genuinely seen this with my own eyes: At the English railway station:
>  "The buffet is open." At the French Railway station: "Le snack bar est
>  ouvert."
