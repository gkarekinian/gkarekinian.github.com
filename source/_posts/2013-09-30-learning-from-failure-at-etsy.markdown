[Great article by John Allspaw][1] (reposted from Etsy's blog) about blameless
post-mortems and Etsy's "Just Culture".

> Having a **Just Culture** means that you’re making effort to balance safety
> **_and_** accountability. It means that by investigating mistakes in a way
> that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the
> decision-making process of individuals proximate to the failure, an
> organization can come out safer than it would normally be if it had simply
> punished the actors involved as a remediation.
