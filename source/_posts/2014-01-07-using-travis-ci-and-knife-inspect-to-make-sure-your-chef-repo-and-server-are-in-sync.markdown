I wrote an article on 5apps' Developer Blog about using [Travis CI][travis_ci] to
ensure your Chef repo and server are in sync:

[5apps Developer Blog - Using Travis CI to make sure your Chef repo and server
are in sync][5apps_blog]

I'm also proud to announce I've taken over as the new maintainer of
[knife-inspect][knife-inspect]! It's now compatible with Chef 11 and returns
the proper return codes. Expect to see more soon!
