> Robbins needs to get close to his victims without setting off alarm bells.
> "If I come at you head-on, like this," he said, stepping forward, "I'm going
> to run into that bubble of your personal space very quickly, and that's
> going to make you uncomfortable." He took a step back. "So, what I do is I
> give you a point of focus, say a coin. Then I break eye contact by looking
> down, and I pivot around the point of focus, stepping forward in an arc, or
> a semicircle, till I'm in your space." He demonstrated, winding up shoulder
> to shoulder with me, looking up at me sideways, his head cocked, all
> innocence. "See how I was able to close the gap?" he said. "I flew in under
> your radar and I have access to all your pockets."
